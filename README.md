# Arduino-Flash-utility
I wanted a way to read/write some MB of data into/out of flash memory without the need of any specialized tools. This tool establishes serial communication with an arduino board flashed with the included software, with minimal user input needed in a PS script. Tested with Arduino Pro Mini atmega328 @3.3V 8MHz and Winbond W25Q64
